<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Now We are living in Big Data Era.
Few years ago, Systems or Organizations or Applications were using all Structured Data only ( Structured Data means In the form of Rows and Columns). It was very easy to use Relational Data Bases (RDBMS) and old Tools to store, manage, process and report this Data.
However recently, Nature of Data is changed. And Systems or Organizations or Applications are generating huge amount of Data in variety of formats at very fast rate.
That means Data is not simple Structured Data(Not in the form of simple Rows and Columns). It does not have any proper format, just RawData without any format. It is “very difficult or not possible” to use Old Technologies, Traditional Relational Databases and Tools to store, manage, process and report this Data. Traditional DataBases cannot Store, Process and Analysis this kind of Data.
Then how to solve this problem? Here BigData Solutions come into picture.
Big Data Solutions solve all these problems very easily.
